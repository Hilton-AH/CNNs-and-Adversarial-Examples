# **CNNs & Adversarial Examples**

## Introduction

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) shine in areas like disease detection and self-driving cars, they're susceptible to **adversarial examples.

## Understanding Adversarial Examples

Adversarial examples are inputs slightly tweaked to deceive AI. For instance, an altered image might wrongly lead a CNN to misclassify a rhino.

## Potential Risks

Key sectors face challenges due to this vulnerability:

- **Self-Driving Cars:** Misinterpreting traffic signs.
- **Medical Imaging:** Incorrect tumor evaluations.
- **Security Systems:** Evading facial recognition.

## Project Objective

We'll produce adversarial examples to confuse our model. This exploration emphasizes the necessity to grasp AI weaknesses and robust testing.

**Key Takeaway:** Advanced AI models, despite their prowess, have blind spots. Identifying and mitigating these is crucial.
